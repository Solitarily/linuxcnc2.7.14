moveoff_demo5

This demo is identical to moveoff_demo2 except it uses a special HALFILE:
   [HAL]HALFILE = LIB:hookup_moveoff.tcl
to load and automatically connect the moveoff component.

This script allows the moveoff component to be added to a configuration without making changes to existing halfiles.

See moveoff_demo3 for more information
