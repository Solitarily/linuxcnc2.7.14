moveoff_demo6

Simulation configurations usually connect the motor-pos-cmd and motor-pos-fb pins together (shortcircuited).  This configuration is also applicable to open-loop (stepper systems) and makes it possible for simulations to run with no external hardware.  Servo systems use separate paths for command and feedback and the servo loop is completed with hal components (often using a pid component).

This demonstration uses a special [HAL]HALFILE = removeshort.hal to connect the motor-pos-cmd and motor-pos-fb pins in a manner similar to servo hardware in that the command and feedback information is separated.

This separated connection is needed to verify that the hookup_moveoff script works correctly with both servo and stepper system configurations.


This demo is otherwise identical to moveoff_demo4 (which is a different implementation of moveoff_demo2).
