moveoff_demo3

This demo shows how the moveoff.comp and the moveoff_gui behave with an external program controlling offsets.

When a program is paused, the moveoff_gui pops up to show the current offset values and status.  No inputs or conrols are provided.

A sim_pin utility application simulates the external application that provides outputs for move-enable and the offset input values for three axes.  The application could be realized using connections of hal components to interface to a jog wheel with a switch to select axes and a switch to manage the move-enable pin.

A halscope session is started (select 'Roll' to start) to show behavior of important moveoff inputs and outputs

The options to the moveoff_gui can be modified by editing the ini file
[APPLICATIONS] APP = moveoff_gui ...
For more info: moveoff_gui --help |more

Note: This is a Hal-only implementation and the offset positions are NOT shown on the axis gui preview.
