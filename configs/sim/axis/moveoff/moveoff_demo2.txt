moveoff_demo2

This demonstration uses the moveoff_gui that will popup when the running program is paused.

The moveoff_gui:

 1) provides a checkbutton to enable offsets
 2) entry box for offset values (x,y,z)
 3) display of current offset values (x,y,z)
 4) panel showing state of the move-enable and offsets
    RED    enabled and offsets applied
    GREEN  disabled and offsets removed
    YELLOW removing offsets
    CYAN   enabled with no offsets applied

A halscope session is started (select 'Roll' to start) to show behavior of important moveoff inputs and outputs

The options to the moveoff_gui can be modified by editing the ini file
[APPLICATIONS] APP = moveoff_gui ...
For more info: moveoff_gui --help |more

Note: This is a Hal-only implementation and the offset positions are NOT shown on the axis gui preview.
